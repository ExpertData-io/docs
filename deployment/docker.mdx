## Overview

Docker Compose is the simplest way to deploy ExpertEngine for development or small teams.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop 20.0+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Git

## Quick Deploy

```bash
# Clone infrastructure repo
git clone https://github.com/ExpertData-io/expertengine-infra.git
cd expertengine-infra/local

# Start all services
make up

# Check status
make status
```

## Services

| Service    | Port      | Description       |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Frontend   | 3000      | Web application   |
| Backend    | 8030      | API server        |
| Executor   | 8040      | Execution service |
| PostgreSQL | 5432      | Database          |
| MinIO      | 9000/9001 | Object storage    |
| MLflow     | 5000      | ML tracking       |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy and edit the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key variables:

```bash
# Database
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# JWT Secret
SECRET_KEY=your-32-character-key

# LLM API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Volume Mounts

Data is persisted in Docker volumes:

- `postgres_data` - Database files
- `minio_data` - Object storage
- `mlflow_data` - MLflow artifacts

## Commands

```bash
# Start services
make up

# Stop services
make down

# View logs
make logs

# Restart a service
docker compose restart backend

# Rebuild after code changes
make rebuild
```

## Production Considerations

<Warning>
  Docker Compose is not recommended for production. Use Kubernetes for
  scalability and reliability.
</Warning>

If you must use Docker Compose in production:

1. Use a reverse proxy (Nginx) with HTTPS
2. Enable database backups
3. Use external PostgreSQL (RDS)
4. Monitor with Prometheus
