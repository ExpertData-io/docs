## What is Genie?

**Genie** is ExpertEngine's AI assistant. Ask questions in plain English, and Genie will:

- Generate SQL queries for you
- Create visualizations and charts
- Explain your data patterns
- Suggest optimizations

<Tip>
  Genie works best when you have at least one connector set up. [Add your first
  connector](/getting-started/connectors) to get started.
