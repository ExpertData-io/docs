## What are Datasets?

**Datasets** are saved snapshots of query results. Use them to:

- Save query results for later analysis
- Share data with team members
- Create reference data for joins
- Preview data without running queries each time

## Creating a Dataset

### From a Task

1. Run a task
2. Click **Save as Dataset**
3. Name your dataset
4. Click **Save**

### From Genie

1. Ask Genie a question
2. When results appear, click **Save as Dataset**
3. Name it and save

### From the Query Editor

1. Go to **Queries** in the sidebar
2. Write and run your query
3. Click **Save as Dataset**

## Viewing Datasets

1. Click **Datasets** in the sidebar
2. Browse your saved datasets
3. Click any dataset to preview its data

### Dataset Preview

The preview shows:

- **Columns**: All available fields
- **Sample Data**: First rows of the dataset
- **Row Count**: Total number of records
- **Created/Updated**: When the dataset was saved

## Refreshing Datasets

Datasets are snapshots—they don't update automatically. To refresh:

1. Open the dataset
2. Click **Refresh**
3. The query re-runs and updates the data

<Tip>
  Need automatic updates? Create a pipeline that refreshes the dataset on a
  schedule.
</Tip>

## Using Datasets

### In Tasks

Reference datasets in SQL:

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.total
FROM customers c
JOIN my_saved_dataset o ON c.id = o.customer_id
```

### In Genie

Tell Genie to use your dataset:

> "Using the monthly_sales dataset, show me the top 10 products"

## Managing Datasets

### Rename a Dataset

1. Open the dataset
2. Click the name to edit
3. Save changes

### Delete a Dataset

1. Go to **Datasets**
2. Click the three-dot menu
3. Select **Delete**

<Warning>
  Deleting a dataset cannot be undone. Tasks that reference it will fail.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

| Do                          | Don't                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Use descriptive names       | Use generic names like "data_1" |
| Add descriptions            | Leave datasets undocumented     |
| Refresh regularly if needed | Rely on stale data              |
| Delete unused datasets      | Let them accumulate             |
