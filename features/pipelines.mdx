## What are Pipelines?

**Pipelines** chain multiple tasks together into automated workflows. Use them to:

- Run tasks in sequence
- Schedule recurring data jobs
- Handle errors and retries
- Build end-to-end data processes

## Creating a Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Pipelines">
    Click **Pipelines** in the sidebar, then click **+ New Pipeline**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Pipeline">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Daily Sales ETL"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tasks">Drag tasks from the left panel onto the canvas</Step>
  <Step title="Connect Tasks">
    Draw lines between tasks to define the execution order
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Schedule (Optional)">
    Set up when the pipeline should run automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">Click **Save** to save your pipeline</Step>
</Steps>

## The Pipeline Canvas

The visual canvas lets you design your workflow:

- **Tasks** appear as boxes
- **Arrows** show data flow direction
- **Colors** indicate task status when running

### Adding Tasks

1. Click **+ Add Task** or drag from the task list
2. Select an existing task or create a new one
3. Position it on the canvas

### Connecting Tasks

1. Hover over a task's right edge
2. Drag to create a connection
3. Drop on another task's left edge

## Scheduling Pipelines

Run pipelines automatically on a schedule:

| Schedule          | Example                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Hourly**        | Every hour at :00                |
| **Daily**         | Every day at 6:00 AM             |
| **Weekly**        | Every Monday at 9:00 AM          |
| **Monthly**       | 1st of each month                |
| **Custom (Cron)** | `0 6 * * 1-5` (weekdays at 6 AM) |

### Setting a Schedule

1. Open your pipeline
2. Click **Schedule** tab
3. Choose frequency
4. Set the time
5. Save

## Running Pipelines

### Manual Run

1. Open the pipeline
2. Click **Run Now**
3. Monitor progress on the canvas

### Viewing Run History

1. Go to the pipeline
2. Click **Runs** tab
3. See all past executions with status

## Error Handling

When a task fails:

1. The pipeline stops at that task
2. You see an error message
3. Fix the issue
4. Click **Retry** to continue from the failed task

<Warning>Tasks after a failed task won't run until you fix and retry.</Warning>

## Example Pipeline

**Daily Customer Report**

```
[Fetch Orders] → [Calculate Metrics] → [Generate Report] → [Send Email]
```

1. **Fetch Orders**: SQL query to get today's orders
2. **Calculate Metrics**: Python script to compute KPIs
3. **Generate Report**: Format data as HTML report
4. **Send Email**: Deliver to stakeholders
