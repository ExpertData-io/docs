## What are Tasks?

**Tasks** are saved SQL queries or Python scripts that you can run on demand or schedule. Use them to:

- Save queries you run frequently
- Transform data before analysis
- Create reusable building blocks for pipelines

## Creating a Task

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Tasks">
    Click **Tasks** in the sidebar, then click **+ New Task**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Task Type">
    Select **SQL** or **Python** depending on your needs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Connector">
    Choose which database to run the query against
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Your Query">
    Enter your SQL query or Python code in the editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test It">Click **Run** to preview the results</Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Give your task a name and description, then click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SQL Tasks

SQL tasks run queries against your connected databases.

### Example: Monthly Sales Summary

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
    SUM(total_amount) AS revenue,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

### Using Parameters

Make your tasks dynamic with parameters:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= :start_date
  AND order_date <= :end_date
  AND region = :region
```

When running the task, you'll be prompted to enter values for `start_date`, `end_date`, and `region`.

## Python Tasks

Python tasks let you run Python scripts for advanced transformations.

### Example: Data Cleaning

```python
import pandas as pd

# Input data comes from the previous step
df = input_data

# Clean and transform
df['email'] = df['email'].str.lower().str.strip()
df['created_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_at'])
df = df.dropna(subset=['email'])

# Output for next step
output_data = df
```

## Running Tasks

### Run Manually

1. Open the task
2. Enter any required parameters
3. Click **Run**
4. View results in the preview pane

### Run via Pipeline

Tasks can be chained together in pipelines for automated execution.

## Task Status

| Status         | Meaning                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 🟢 **Success** | Task completed without errors |
| 🔴 **Failed**  | Task encountered an error     |
| 🟡 **Running** | Task is currently executing   |
| ⚪ **Pending** | Task is queued to run         |
