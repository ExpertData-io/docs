## What are Notebooks?

**Notebooks** are interactive workspaces for exploring data. Like Jupyter notebooks, they let you:

- Run SQL and Python code in cells
- Mix queries with markdown notes
- Visualize results inline
- Save and share your analysis

## Creating a Notebook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Notebooks">Click **Notebooks** in the sidebar</Step>
  <Step title="Create New">Click **+ New Notebook**</Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Notebook">
    Give it a meaningful title like "Q1 Sales Analysis"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Cells

Notebooks contain **cells** that hold your code or text:

### Types of Cells

| Type         | Use For                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **SQL**      | Running database queries     |
| **Python**   | Data processing and analysis |
| **Markdown** | Notes, headers, explanations |

### Adding Cells

1. Click between cells or at the bottom
2. Click **+ Add Cell**
3. Choose the cell type

### Running Cells

- Click the **▶ Run** button on a cell
- Or press **Shift + Enter** to run and move to next
- Or press **Ctrl + Enter** to run and stay

## SQL Cells

Write SQL queries against your connected databases:

```sql
-- Select a connector first
SELECT
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity) as total_sold
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Results appear as a table below the cell.

## Python Cells

Use Python for advanced analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Previous cell results are available as 'df'
df = _  # Last cell output

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df['product_name'], df['total_sold'])
plt.title('Top 10 Products')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

## Markdown Cells

Add documentation with Markdown:

```markdown
# Q1 Sales Analysis

## Summary

This notebook analyzes sales performance for Q1 2024.

### Key Findings

- Revenue increased 15% vs Q4
- Top category: Electronics
```

## Sharing Notebooks

1. Click **Share** in the top right
2. Choose team members or copy a link
3. Set permissions (view/edit)

## Saving Work

- Notebooks auto-save as you work
- Click **Save** to save manually
- Use **Version History** to restore previous versions

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut        | Action                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Shift + Enter` | Run cell, move to next              |
| `Ctrl + Enter`  | Run cell, stay in place             |
| `Esc`           | Exit edit mode                      |
| `Enter`         | Enter edit mode                     |
| `A`             | Insert cell above (in command mode) |
| `B`             | Insert cell below (in command mode) |
| `DD`            | Delete cell (in command mode)       |
