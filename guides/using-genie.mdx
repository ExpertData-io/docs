```

### Analyze Data

```
What's the total revenue this month?
```

```

```

### Create Visualizations

```

```

## Advanced Techniques

### Specify Data Sources

If you have multiple connectors:

```
Using the analytics database, show me user signups by month
```

### Chain Analyses

Build on previous results:

```
You: Show me revenue by product category
Genie: [Shows results]

You: Now show the same for last year
Genie: [Shows year-over-year comparison]

You: Calculate the growth rate
Genie: [Calculates percentage change]
```

### Create Resources

Create a task that calculates daily revenue and save it as "Daily Revenue Report"
```

```

```
