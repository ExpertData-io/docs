## Overview

Learn how to:

1. Create a reporting pipeline
2. Schedule it to run automatically
3. Monitor execution

**Time to complete**: 20 minutes

## The Goal

We'll build a system that:

- Runs every Monday morning
- Calculates weekly KPIs
- Saves results as a dataset

## Step 1: Create Report Tasks

### Weekly Sales Task

Create a task with this query:

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', order_date) AS week,
    COUNT(*) AS orders,
    SUM(amount) AS revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY 1;
```

Name it "Weekly Sales Summary".

### Top Products Task

Create another task:

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity) AS units_sold,
    SUM(price * quantity) AS revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE oi.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Name it "Weekly Top Products".

## Step 2: Build the Pipeline

1. Go to **Pipelines** → **+ New Pipeline**
2. Name it "Weekly Report"
3. Add both tasks to the canvas
4. They can run in parallel (no connection needed) or sequentially

## Step 3: Schedule for Monday

1. Open the **Schedule** tab
2. Enable scheduling
3. Select **Weekly** on **Monday** at **8:00 AM**
4. Save

## Step 4: Monitor Results

After the pipeline runs:

1. Go to **Pipelines**
2. Click on "Weekly Report"
3. Open the **Runs** tab
4. Check the status of each run

### Status Meanings

| Status         | Meaning                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ✅ **Success** | All tasks completed          |
| ❌ **Failed**  | One or more tasks had errors |
| 🔄 **Running** | Currently executing          |

## Troubleshooting

**Pipeline didn't run?**

- Check the schedule is enabled
- Verify the timezone is correct

**Task failed?**

- Click on the failed task
- View the error message
- Fix and retry
