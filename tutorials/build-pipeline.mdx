## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll create a pipeline that:

1. Fetches data from your database
2. Transforms it with SQL
3. Runs on a schedule

**Time to complete**: 15 minutes

## Prerequisites

- At least one [connector](/getting-started/connectors) set up
- One or more [tasks](/features/tasks) created

## Step 1: Create Tasks

First, let's create the tasks our pipeline will use.

### Task 1: Fetch Daily Orders

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Tasks">
    Click **Tasks** → **+ New Task**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write the Query">
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        order_id,
        customer_id,
        total_amount,
        created_at
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Name it "Fetch Daily Orders" and save
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Task 2: Calculate Summary

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Another Task">
    Click **Tasks** → **+ New Task**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write the Summary">
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS order_count,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue,
        AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_value
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Name it "Daily Summary" and save
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create the Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Pipelines">Click **Pipelines** → **+ New Pipeline**</Step>
  <Step title="Name It">Call it "Daily Orders Report"</Step>
  <Step title="Add First Task">Drag "Fetch Daily Orders" onto the canvas</Step>
  <Step title="Add Second Task">Drag "Daily Summary" onto the canvas</Step>
  <Step title="Connect Them">
    Draw a line from the first task to the second
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">Click **Save**</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Test Your Pipeline

1. Click **Run Now**
2. Watch the tasks execute in sequence
3. Verify both complete successfully (green status)

## Step 4: Schedule It

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Schedule Tab">Click the **Schedule** tab</Step>
  <Step title="Enable Scheduling">Toggle on "Run on schedule"</Step>
  <Step title="Set Frequency">Choose "Daily" at 6:00 AM</Step>
  <Step title="Save">Click **Save**</Step>
</Steps>

Your pipeline will now run every morning at 6 AM!
